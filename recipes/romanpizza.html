    <p>This Roman-style pizza has a long-fermented thicker crust, and is absolutely awesome. Topped with prepared sauce, sausage, sweet peppers, and three cheeses, or with whatever you like, you'll want to make this on repeat.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h5>Dough</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>4 1/4 cups bread flour (500 grams)</li>
        <li>1 rounded teaspoon dry yeast (3.5 grams)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups plus 3 tablespoons water (400 ml)</li>
        <li>generous 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil (20 ml), plus 2 teaspoons more to oil container</li>
        <li>rounded 1 1/2 teaspoons sea salt or kosher salt (10 grams)</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Pizza</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>6 ounces Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 cup diced sweet peppers and onions</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups prepared pizza sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese </li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>For dough, mix together flour, yeast, and water with a wooden spoon until almost all flour has disappeared and a rough dough is formed.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add salt and olive oil and continue mixing with a spoon for about 3 minutes until a smooth, very soft and sticky dough forms. Clean off spoon and scrape down bowl. Cover and let rest 15 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Perform first set of rotating folds: leaving dough in the bowl, with a damp hand, reach under and grab the dough at the edge of the bowl, pull it and stretch it over the top. Rotate the bowl a few inches and repeat about 10 or 12 times, then gather the dough into a ball as best you can, turning the smoothest side up. Cover the bowl, and let dough rest for 15 minutes. Repeat this stretch, fold, and rest process 2 more times.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Transfer dough into an oiled container with a lid, rub dough with a few drops of olive oil and cover. Refrigerate for 24 hours or until doubled in size.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Transfer dough to the counter. With damp hands press and stretch dough into a square about 15 inches wide. Fold in half, and then in half again to create a rectangle. Fold rectangle into thirds, and turn over so the seam side is down.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Shape back into a neat ball with damp hand. Transfer dough into an oiled container, rub with a few drops of olive oil, and cover. Refrigerate for an additional 24 hours or until doubled in size.</li><br>
        <li>Remove dough from the refrigerator and let stand on the counter for 1 hour to come to room temperature.</li><br>
        <li>Meanwhile, prepare toppings: Cook and stir sausage in a skillet over medium heat until browned and crumbly, breaking up any clumps with a spatula, about 10 minutes. Remove from the pan; set aside to cool. Add red peppers and onions to the same skillet, and cook and stir just until they begin to soften, 3 to 5 minutes; remove and set aside.</li><br>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (250 degrees C). Oil a sheet pan generously with olive oil. A sheet of parchment paper can be placed on the pan to prevent sticking.</li><br>
        <li>Transfer dough to the prepared sheet pan. Use oiled fingers to press dough into a rectangle that almost covers the pan. If dough is too elastic to stay in place, let it rest for a minute, and then continue stretching and pressing into place.</li><br>
        <li>Drizzle a teaspoon of olive oil over dough and brush to coat evenly. </li><br>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Remove pizza crust to a cooling rack to cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes. Remove parchment from pan if used, then return crust to the pan.</li><br>
        <li>Spread crust with sauce, scatter over sausage and vegetables, sprinkle with mozzarella and Monterey Jack cheese, and finish with a dusting of Parmesan.</li><br>
